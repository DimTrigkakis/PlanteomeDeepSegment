    This application allows the user to run a deep learning classifier on the image. Only an input image is required.
    <br><br>
    <b>Steps to run the algorithm:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Select an image to be analyzed. This image can either come from images already loaded into your account or publicly available images. User can even upload images on this page itself.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Press the 'Run' button. Analysis may take some time depending on the image.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    3. If the algorithm classifies the object successfully, the classification results and resulting distribution will be shown on top of the image.
